# ScienceNotes
Just a keyboard for science notes on a Mac. Option gets you to most of the lower-case Greek alphabet. Shift-option gets you to some of the Greek uppercase, and some other stuff. 

Install to "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" and then open "Keyboard Preferences/Input Sources" and it should be listed under "Others" or you can click the "+" button and search for "Science".

You can also install to "/Library/Keyboard Layouts" but you may need to reboot to get it to show. The nice thing is it will then also be available for system functions, like login.
